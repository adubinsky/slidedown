## What Buyers and Sellers Need to Know in 2026

**Andrew D.**
**Feb. 2nd, 2026**

Note: Welcome everyone. Today we're going to cover the current state of tax credit transfers - what works, what doesn't, and how to actually get deals done in this market.

## Agenda

- >> The Buyer Perspective: What makes deals work (and fail)
- ^^^ The Seller Perspective: Why credits don't sell
- vvv Market Dynamics: Where this industry is heading
- ---> Building a Process: From chaos to repeatable
- <--- Credit Deep Dives: 45Z, 45X, 25D ending
- +++ Q&A

Note: Here's what we'll cover. Feel free to drop questions in chat - we'll address them throughout and have dedicated Q&A at the end.

## The Market Opportunity

- >> **$50B+** in transferable credits created annually
- ^^^ Growing demand from corporate tax departments
- vvv But: most credits aren't ready to transact
- ---> Deals die in diligence, not negotiation

*Source: IRA transferability provisions, market data*

Note: Let's start with the big picture. There's no shortage of tax credits. I could send you $8 billion worth of credits right now. The problem isn't finding them - it's finding ones that are actually ready to close.

# The Buyer Perspective

## What makes deals work

- ^^^ What kills deals
- vvv How to evaluate efficiently

Note: Let's start with what buyers are dealing with. Understanding this helps sellers prepare better, and helps advisors position deals correctly.

---

## The Hidden Cost of Saying No

### Every rejected credit costs money

- >> Evaluating 10 credits to buy 1 = all 10 evaluations built into cost
- ^^^ **58% of tax departments are under-resourced**[^1]
- vvv Goal: Kill 80% in 5 minutes, 15% in 30 minutes
- ---> Build a filtering system, not just sourcing

[^1]: Thomson Reuters/TEI 2025 State of Corporate Tax Department: 58% under-resourced

Note: Every credit you look at and reject actually costs you money. Your client's time is expensive. The goal isn't to see more deals - it's to quickly identify which ones are worth your time.

## The 7-Year Problem

### You're not buying tax savings, you're entering a relationship

- >> **Years 0-5:** Clawback exposure period
- ^^^ **Years 5-7:** IRS audit tail
- vvv The institutional memory problem
- ---> 38% of tax depts plan new hires in 1-2 years[^2]
- <--- The person who approved may not be there when IRS asks

[^2]: Thomson Reuters 2025: 38% planning to hire new qualified tax professionals

Note: When you buy a tax credit, you're not buying a one-time tax savings. You're entering a 7-year relationship. The person who approved this credit may not be there 4 years from now when the IRS comes knocking. That's why documentation matters.

## There Is No Option C

### Insurance Reality in 2026

- >> Two acceptable scenarios: +++Investment grade seller+++ OR +++insurance+++
- ^^^ Self-indemnification doesn't work anymore
- vvv Political uncertainty made insurance non-negotiable
- ---> Covers: recapture, disallowance, audit defense
- <--- Seller pays, built into net price

Note: For sophisticated buyers in 2026, there are only two acceptable scenarios. Investment grade seller, or insurance. That's it. We're not going to take the credit without one of those two things.

---

## What a Complete Package Looks Like

### Documentation separates 4-week from 6-month closes

- >> 10 non-negotiable documents
- ^^^ **Red flags** that kill deals: no registration, no insurance + non-IG
- vvv **Yellow flags** that slow things down
- ---> Credit-specific requirements (45Z, 45X, 48E)
- <--- Difference between 4-week and 6-month close = documentation

Note: Here's what separates a credit that closes in 4 weeks from one that takes 6 months - or never closes at all. Documentation. A complete package includes these 10 things...

# The Seller Perspective

## Understanding why credits don't sell

- ^^^ The math on timing
- vvv What buyers actually want

Note: Now let's flip to the seller side. If you're advising developers or credit generators, this is what they need to hear.

---

## Why Your Credit Hasn't Sold

### If trying to sell 30+ days, something is wrong

- >> Price expectations vs market reality (down 1-2 points)
- ^^^ The insurance surprise: buyers require it, you didn't budget
- vvv Documentation gaps
- ---> The timing trap: waiting costs more than you think

Note: If you've been trying to sell your tax credits for more than 30 days, something is wrong. Let's talk about what it probably is.

---

## The Real Math on Timing

### Opportunity cost: **¼ cent per month**

Example scenario:
- Want 92¢, offered 90¢
- ^^^ Wait 3 months, accept 90.5¢
- vvv Gained 0.5 points, lost 0.75 in opportunity cost
- ---> **NET: Lost 0.25 points by waiting**

$$
\text{Gain} = 0.005 \times \text{Credit Value}
$$

$$
\text{Cost} = 0.0025 \times 3 \times \text{Credit Value}
$$

$$
\text{Net Loss} = 0.0025 \times \text{Credit Value}
$$

Note: Let's do the actual math. It's a quarter of a cent per month just sitting on your books. So if you wait 3 months hoping for a better price...

## What Buyers Actually Care About

### Not price negotiations - these five things

1. >> Investment grade status or insurance (binary)
2. ^^^ IRS registration (must be done before transaction)
3. vvv Documentation completeness (don't make them chase)
4. ---> Clean chain of title
5. <--- Realistic timeline expectations

Note: I talk to credit buyers every day. Here's what actually moves the needle on getting your deal done. Not price negotiations - these five things.

# Market Dynamics

## Where this industry is heading

- ^^^ Why this isn't a simple marketplace
- vvv Where to find credits
- ---> Where the market is heading

Note: Now let's zoom out and look at the market itself. Understanding these dynamics helps you position yourself for what's coming.

---

## Why Tax Credits Will Never Be eBay

### The "metal on metal" problem

- >> Can't just click and transact
- ^^^ Developers list credits that aren't ready to close
- vvv Buyers encounter documentation gaps
- ---> Deals require human facilitation
- <--- **This is a broker market, not an exchange**

Note: Every few months, someone tries to build the stock exchange for tax credits. Here's why it never works. You can't just match buyer and seller and walk away.

---

## Where to Find Tax Credits in 2026

### Five main channels with different tradeoffs

- >> **Traditional brokers:** complex deals, relationship value
- ^^^ **Investment banks:** large transactions, institutional rigor
- vvv **Online marketplaces** (Crux/Reunion): research, broad sourcing
- ---> **Direct developer relationships:** best pricing, most effort
- <--- **Accounting firm networks:** trust-based, limited scale

Note: There are five main channels for sourcing tax credits. Each has tradeoffs on deal size, speed, pricing, and effort required.

---

::: #667eea

## The Broker Displacement Thesis

### A prediction that might be uncomfortable

- >> **In 5 years:** most traditional brokers out of business
- ^^^ Banks and accounting firms entering the space
- vvv They already have buyer/seller relationships
- ---> **Value shifting:** finding credits → evaluating and closing
- <--- Technology-enabled processes will win

Note: Here's a prediction that might be uncomfortable for some: In 5 years, most tax credit brokers will be out of business. Here's who wins instead.

---

## What OB3 Actually Changed

### Political uncertainty = #1 challenge for tax departments

- >> Which credits were affected
- ^^^ Form changes coming (45W, 30C, etc.)
- vvv Deadline changes vs documentation changes
- ---> Why insurance companies exited as buyers

*One Big Beautiful Bill Act provisions*

Note: The One Big Beautiful Bill Act created a lot of headlines. Here's what actually matters for tax credit buyers and sellers.

# Building a Process

## From chaos to repeatable

- ^^^ The current state of most organizations
- vvv Building repeatable systems
- ---> Why your clients need you

Note: Let's talk about how to actually operationalize this. Most organizations are still figuring this out.

---

::: #1a1a1a

## The Spreadsheet Problem

### "We have four spreadsheets with different crap on them"

- >> Most tax departments manage credits on spreadsheets
- ^^^ No audit trail, no institutional memory
- vvv Staff turnover = knowledge loss
- ---> **59% lack confidence to upgrade tech**[^3]

[^3]: Thomson Reuters 2025: 59% lack confidence in tech upgrades

Note: "We're running a spreadsheet, right? We probably have four spreadsheets with different crap on them. It's clunky." That's a direct quote from a tax professional at a major firm.

---

::: #667eea

## Building a Repeatable Process

### Your 1st purchase shouldn't take longer than your 10th

- >> The 8-step intake process
- ^^^ Standard checklists by credit type
- vvv 7 questions to answer for every credit
- ---> **Scale:** 1/year → multiple/quarter

Note: Your first credit purchase shouldn't take longer than your tenth. If it does, you don't have a process - you have a series of one-off projects.

## Why Your Clients Need You

### They literally cannot do this themselves

| Stat                                          | Impact             |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| >> **58%** under-resourced                    | Need external help |
| ^^^ **69%** stuck in reactive mode            | Can't be strategic |
| vvv Want 70% strategic, spend **46%**         | Time gap           |
| ---> Under-resourced = **50% more** penalties | Real risk          |

*Thomson Reuters/TEI 2025 State of Corporate Tax Department*

Note: Your clients have tax liability. There are billions in credits available. If you're not helping them access this, someone else will. They literally cannot do this themselves.

# Credit Deep Dives

- >> 45Z: Clean Fuel Production
- ^^^ 45X: Advanced Manufacturing
- vvv 25D: Residential Solar

Note: Let's get specific about the major credit types and what's unique about each one.

## 45Z: Clean Fuel Production Credits

### Hottest credit type - and hardest to sell

- >> IRS guidance gaps creating buyer hesitancy
- ^^^ Life cycle analysis (LCA) requirements
- vvv Feedstock documentation critical
- ---> Volume opportunity: **$200-450MM** for major producers

*IRS Notice 2024-XX, SAF guidance pending*

Note: 45Z is where the money is - and where the complexity is. Lawyers are requiring insurance for 45Z deals even when they don't for 45X. That's how uncertain this space is right now.

## 45X: Advanced Manufacturing Credits

### Cleanest credits in the market

- >> FIAC compliance critical for 2026+
- ^^^ Foreign-connected entity considerations
- vvv Buyers more comfortable here than 45Z
- ---> Clear documentation requirements

*FIAC = Foreign Entity of Concern rules*

Note: 45X credits are some of the cleanest in the market - if you understand the FIAC rules. Buyers feel more comfortable here because the guidance is clearer.

## 25D: Residential Solar - The Pause

### Hot in 2024, then institutional buyers disappeared

- >> Guidance uncertainty causing hesitancy
- ^^^ Clawback perception vs reality (only **0.5%** actual rate)
- vvv Major funders paused for regulatory clarity
- ---> Alternative strategies for sellers

*Clawback rate data from market participants*

Note: Residential solar credits were hot in 2024. Then institutional buyers disappeared. Here's why and what it means for sellers in this space.

# Common Questions

## Quick answers to frequently asked questions

- ^^^ Minimum deal size?
- vvv How long to close?
- ---> Who pays for insurance?
- <--- IRS registration requirements?

Note: Before we open up for live questions, let me hit a few of the most common ones I get.

---

::: #667eea

## FAQ: Minimum Deal Size?

- >> **$10M floor** for most advisors
- ^^^ Below that, transaction costs eat the savings
- vvv **Exception:** programmatic relationships with ongoing volume
- ---> **Sweet spot:** $10M-$100M

Note: Can I sell a $2 million credit? Short answer: probably not. The transaction costs - legal, diligence, insurance - don't scale down enough.

---

## FAQ: How Long to Close?

### It depends on seller preparation

| Scenario                           | Timeline       |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------- |
| ^^^ Clean deal, prepared seller    | **4-6 weeks**  |
| vvv Messy deal, documentation gaps | **3-6 months** |
| ---> Some never close              | **Never**      |

Note: "These deals go really fast. I could send something today and it's gone tomorrow." That's true - but only if the seller is prepared. Most aren't.

---

## FAQ: Who Pays for Insurance?

### Short answer: the seller

- >> Cost built into the net price
- ^^^ Typically **1-3%** of credit value
- vvv Buyer gets protection, seller gets market access

$$
\text{Net to Seller} = \text{Gross Price} - \text{Insurance Cost}
$$

Note: The short answer is: the seller pays, but it's built into the net price. Think of it as cost of doing business in today's market.

---

::: #1a1a1a

## FAQ: IRS Registration?

### Required before transfer can occur

- >> Both buyer and seller must register
- ^^^ Process takes **2-4 weeks** typically
- vvv No registration = deal killer

*IRS Clean Energy Credit Registration Portal*

Note: Registration is non-negotiable. Both parties need to be registered before the transfer can happen. If you're not registered, sophisticated buyers won't even talk to you.

# Key Takeaways

## If you remember nothing else...
