## Fragment Animations

Watch elements reveal with different animations:

- >> This appears first (basic reveal)
- ^^^ This fades up from bottom
- vvv This fades down from top
- ---> This slides in from right
- <--- This slides in from left

---

## More Fragment Effects

Transform and highlight content:

- +++ This grows larger
- ... This shrinks smaller
- ~~~ This strikes through
- >>red This highlights in red
- >>green This highlights in green
- >>blue This highlights in blue

---

## Inline Fragments

You can also use fragments +++inline within text+++ to make specific words or phrases stand out.

This sentence has ^^^some words that fade up^^^ and ~~~others that strike through~~~.

Perfect for +++emphasizing+++ key concepts!

function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet('World'));
```

Block equations reveal: vvv

$$
\int_0^\infty e^{-x^2} dx = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}
$$

Full LaTeX support via KaTeX! +++

## Comparison: Old vs New

**Old HTML Comment Syntax:**
```markdown
- Item <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-up" -->
<!-- .slide: data-background="#667eea" -->
```

**New Markdown-Native Syntax:**
```markdown
- ^^^ Item
::: #667eea
```

- ^^^ Cleaner
- vvv More readable
- ---> Truly markdown-native

::: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%)

## The Power of Symbols

- ^^^ `^^^` means "fade up" (arrows up)
- vvv `vvv` means "fade down" (arrows down)
- ---> `--->` means "slide right" (arrow right)
- <--- `<---` means "slide left" (arrow left)
- +++ `+++` means "grow" (getting bigger)
- ... `...` means "shrink" (fading away)

Intuitive and visual! +++

## Complex Layouts

::: #1a1a1a

You can combine multiple features:

- ^^^ Background colors
- vvv Fragment animations
- ---> Math equations: $\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$
- <--- Code blocks
- +++ Tables and lists
- >>red Inline highlights

All with +++clean, readable+++ markdown!
